A. Personal Introduction

Hi, I’m Adam Van Blerk 
I am currently completing my Honours degree at the University of the Western Cape, building on my foundation in Computer Science. I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. My long-term career goals include specialising in cybersecurity and quantitative analysis in fraud and risk management, where I can apply analytical thinking to solve complex security and financial challenges.
Outside of academics, I enjoy outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and running, which help me maintain balance and discipline in both my personal and academic life.

B. Education

University of the Western Cape
BSc in Computer Science (Completed 2025)
Honours in Computer Science (Current)
Edgemead High School
National Senior Certificate (Matriculated in 2022)

C. Skills & Interests

Technical Skills
Programming Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, SQL
Databases: MySQL
Data collection, data cleaning, and basic data preprocessing
Full-stack application exposure

Soft Skills
Communication:
Clearly explaining complex technical concepts
Active listening
Negotiation
I have presented projects to different teams and engaged in public speaking, which has strengthened my confidence and clarity when communicating technical ideas.

Teamwork & Collaboration:
Giving and receiving constructive feedback
Mentoring
I consider myself a strong team player, having worked in multiple team-based environments and mentored others when needed.

Academic & Professional Interests

Cybersecurity, particularly understanding how cyber attacks work and how systems are exploited.
Quantitative analysis in fraud detection and risk management.
Interesting Cybersecurity Topic:
One area I find particularly interesting is “Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing in Financial Systems” — specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications (such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting) and how security professionals simulate these attacks to strengthen system defenses.

D. Projects & Competitions
Cogno – Full-Stack Generative AI Application
Last year, I participated in a project called Cogno, a full-stack Generative AI application.
My Role:
Collected data through various methods, including online sources and structured forms completed by users
Converted raw data into clean, structured datasets
Took meeting notes and documented key decisions
Shared documentation with the team to ensure alignment
Outcome:
The project improved my understanding of data pipelines, collaboration in a development team, and the importance of clear documentation in technical projects.

E. Publications
